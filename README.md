## Non-DeterministicFST
A (*hacky!*) Python implementation of Non-Deterministic FST parsing, for educational purposes. NLTK does not offer FST support anymore for Python 3+, and extant Python FST implementations (that I am aware of) are non-trivial to install and use. 

**nfst.py** contains the FST parser, and a few examples.
